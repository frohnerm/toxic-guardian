# Toxic Guardian User Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you get the most out of Toxic Guardian, your personal protection against toxic content online.

## What is Toxic Guardian?

Toxic Guardian is a browser extension that automatically scans web pages for toxic, harassing, or offensive content. When toxic content is detected, it's hidden behind a clickable banner - giving you control over what you see online.

**Key Benefits:**

- **You're in Control**: Toxic content is hidden but can be revealed with a single click
- **Works Everywhere**: Scans regular websites, social media, news sites, and more

## What Content is Detected?

Toxic Guardian scans for six categories of harmful content:

1. **Harassment**: Personal attacks, bullying, intimidation
2. **Hate Speech**: Content targeting groups based on identity
3. **Insults**: Offensive name-calling and slurs
4. **Threats**: Expressions of intent to harm
5. **Profanity**: Explicit and vulgar language
6. **Sexual Content**: Inappropriate sexual comments

**Confidence Levels:**

When you hover over a toxic banner, you'll see the classification:
```
harassment: 87.3%
```

This means the system is 87.3% confident the content is harassment.

## Tips & Best Practices

### When to Reveal Content

**Good reasons to reveal:**
- You need full context of a discussion
- You're reporting abusive content to moderators
- You want to verify a false positive
- Content seems mislabeled

**You might skip revealing:**
- Content is clearly abusive based on surrounding context
- You're in a triggering or stressful state
- The banner provides enough information

---

### Dealing with False Positives

Sometimes innocent content gets flagged (false positives). This can happen with:

- Quotes discussing toxicity (like news articles)
- Historical texts or academic content
- Sarcasm and irony
- Strong opinions that aren't actually toxic

**What to do:**
1. Simply click to reveal - it's harmless
2. Remember the system is being cautious to protect you
3. False positives are rare and easily dismissed

---

### Dealing with False Negatives

Sometimes toxic content isn't detected (false negatives). This can happen with:

- Creative spelling to evade detection (e.g., "h@te")
- Subtle or coded language
- Non-English content
- Very short fragments

**What to do:**
1. Report the content through the website's official channels
2. Block or mute the user (if the platform supports it)
3. Remember: Toxic Guardian is a tool, not a replacement for platform moderation

---

## Privacy & Security

### What Data Does Toxic Guardian Collect?

**None.** Toxic Guardian:

- Does NOT send your browsing data anywhere
- Does NOT track which pages you visit
- Does NOT collect statistics or analytics
- Does NOT communicate with external servers
- Does NOT store your browsing history

**Everything happens locally on your device.**

---

### What Data is Stored?

The extension stores only one preference locally:

- **Threshold setting**: How sensitive the detection should be (default: 0.5)

This is stored using Chrome's `storage.local` API and never leaves your device.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Icon Not Showing

**Try:**
1. Refresh the extensions page: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Make sure the extension is enabled (toggle switch on)
3. Restart your browser
4. Reinstall the extension

---

### Nothing is Being Detected

**Check:**
1. Does the page have actual content? (Some pages are mostly images)
2. Is JavaScript enabled in your browser?
3. Try manually scanning: Click icon → "Run"
4. Check the browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

---

### Too Much Content is Flagged

The detection might be too sensitive.

**To adjust:** (Advanced - requires browser console)
```javascript
// Make detection less sensitive (0.0 = everything, 1.0 = nothing)
chrome.storage.local.set({ threshold: 0.7 });
```

Then reload the extension.

---

### Too Little Content is Flagged

The detection might not be sensitive enough.

**To adjust:** (Advanced)
```javascript
// Make detection more sensitive
chrome.storage.local.set({ threshold: 0.3 });
```

Then reload the extension.

---

### Scans Take Forever

**Possible causes:**
- Very large pages (1000+ text elements)
- Computer is under heavy load
- Browser is low on memory

**Solutions:**
1. Click "Cancel" and try again
2. Close other tabs and applications
3. Wait for page to fully load before scanning
4. Restart browser if problem persists

---
